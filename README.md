## Data Fetching: Fetch API Approach vs SWR Approach

- First, clone the repo to your local machine,
- Then run `yarn` command to install packages and dependencies
- Thirdly, to start the server type terminal `yarn run json-server` which is going to be `5001` port with 2 seconds of delay ( you can update these through `package.json`)
- Finally, `yarn run dev` to see UI on your local machine visit `http://localhost:3000`
